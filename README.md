# euler4

A Clojure library designed to produce numeric palindromes from the product of two n-digit itegers

## Usage

-- Clone this project and cd into the euler4 directory
-- fire up a REPL
-- switch to namespace  euler4.core
-- find out (largest-palindrome multiplier1 multiplier2) about the largest palindrome which can be created from the product 
   of two n-digit numbers by entering:

(largest-palindrome n) where n is a digit between 1 and 7 -  be prepared to wait if you enter 7.

(e.g:  ueler.core => (largest-palindrome 7)
                  => [58666600666685 9999995 5866663])
